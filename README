** Introduction:

With PEAR::Numbers_Words class you can change an integer number
to simple words. This can be usefull when you need to spell a currency
value e.g. on an invoice.

You can choose between several languages (language files are located
in Numbers/Words/ directory).

BTW: if you need to change number to currency, use money_format()
PHP function (available since 4.3 (not yet released)). But you must
know that locale LC_MONETARY rules are sometimes unclear.

** Getting started:

First you need to install Numbers_Words PEAR package.
You can do it (as root) with:

  pear install Numbers_Words

In your php script you need to load Numbers/Words.php header file:

  require_once('Numbers/Words.php');

Then you can call Numbers_Words::toWords() function with two
arguments: integer number (can be a string with digits) and
optional locale name (default is en_US):

$ret = Numbers_Words::toWords($num,"en_GB");
if (PEAR::isError($ret)) {
    echo "Error: " . $ret->message . "\n";
  } else {
    echo "Num $num in British English is '<b>$ret</b>'<p>\n";
}

For  this would display:

Num 12340000000 in British English is '<b>twelve thousand million three hundred forty million</b>'<p>

** Current State:

The current release can be found at the PEAR webpage:
  http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?package=Numbers_Words

For the time of writting this Readme file, Numbers_spell package has the
status beta, which means there can be samo bugs, and it is under development.
This is not mature code.

** Development

This package needs help from people, who can write language modules other
than Polish and English.

** What if numbers have fraction part?

You can split the number by the coma or dot. The example
function was provided by Ernas M. Jamil (see below).
I do not know if the splitting and concatenating numbers
should be supported by Numbers_Words ... Does each language
spell numbers with a 'coma'/'koma'? What do you think?

function num2word($num, $fract = 0) {
        require_once('Numbers/Words.php');

        $num = sprintf("%.".$fract."f", $num);
        $fnum = explode('.', $num);

        $ret =  Numbers_Words::toWords($fnum[0],"id");
        if(!$fract) return $ret;

        $ret .=  ' koma '; // point in english
        $ret .= Numbers_Words::toWords($fnum[1],"id");

        return $ret;
}

** How to convert decimal part and not fraction part of the currency value?

Rob King send me a patch that would allow to leave fraction part in digits.
I.e. you can convert 31.01 into 'thirty-one pounds 01 pence':

  require_once('Numbers/Words.php');
  require_once('Numbers/Words/lang.en_GB.php');

  $obj = new Numbers_Words_en_GB;
  $convert_fraction = false;
  print $obj->toCurrencyWords('GBP', '31', '01', $convert_fraction) . "\n";

** How to write new Language Files:

Just copy existing en_US or en_GB etc. file into lang.{your_country/locale code}.php
and translate digits, numbers, tousands to your language. Then please send it
to the author to the address makler@man.torun.pl.

** Credits

All changes from other people are desrcribed with details in ChangeLog.
There are also names of the people who send me patches etc.
Authors of the language files are mentioned in the language files directly
as the author.
